# Legislate

"Legislate?!" is a board game to teach UK civil servants how a bill is created, debated, and implemented.

## How To Play

An organiser runs the game, deciphers the acronyms, and explains the legal procedues.

The youngest player rolls a six-sided dice. They move their piece the number of spaces indicated on the dice.

If the player lands on a space, the organiser explains what the procedure means.

If the player lands on a ‚ùì, they pick up a card of the same colour and read out the information on it.  If the card has instructions, the player must follow them. The card must be returned to the bottom of the deck.

Play proceeds in a clockwise direction.

The winner is the first player to have their act implemented.
