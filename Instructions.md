# How to play "Legislate?!

"Legislate?!" is a game that takes players on a journey through the legislative process, from "bright idea" to fully implemented law. It works best when there are between 2 and 8 players (though can be played by any number, if you have enough counters!).

The object of the game is to take an idea right through the process and into a fully implemented Act of Parliament.  Each stage of the process is in a different colour on the board.  A set of cards in the relevant colour accompanies each stage of the process.

The cards should be sorted into colours and placed in piles, written side down, next to the area of the playing board of the same colour.  The yellow cards should be handed out when a player has to miss a turn (to help keep track).

All players start with their counters on the "bright idea" lightbulb.

The youngest player rolls first. The players take it in turns to roll the dice and move forward the appropriate number of spaces, counting both the squares with information on and the round "question mark" spaces.

A player who lands on a "question mark" space must pick up a card of the same colour and follow the instructions on the card (e.g. miss a turn, move forward/back a space).

If a card tells a player to "go back to square one" the player must return to the "lightbulb" at the beginning and start the journey again.

If obeying the instructions on the card takes a player on to another "question mark" space, the player may not pick up another card.

A player who lands on the red and green "ping pong" space must pick up one of the red and green striped "ping pong" cards.

The winner is the player who is first to get their idea into a fully implemented Act (or the player who gets nearest, if you run out of time!)

We hope you enjoy playing "Legislate?!" and welcome your feedback on how the game could be improved.

## Prompts for facilitators

Below are prompts that you may find helpful to explain aspects of the process (for those who don't already know) when players land on the boxes (rather than picking up a card).  It would be helpful if most of these could be covered, but you will have to make a judgment as to whether you have time!

## Early Stages

| Board Square | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| BRIGHT IDEA | Get one of your group to think of an idea (you may want to think of one beforehand just in case your group doesn't have any ideas!) |
| DETAILED POLICY WORKED UP | Mention Bill lawyer's role in testing policy<ul><li>is primary legislation needed?</li><li>are there any other routes for achieving what Ministers want?</li><li>do powers already exist?</li><li>can you use secondary legislation to achieve what you want to do?</li><li>are there any non-legislative routes to achieve what Ministers want?</li><li>are there ECHR, EU, devolution issues?</li></ul> |
| WHITE PAPER PUBLISHED | A White Paper is a document which sets out the government's proposals for future legislation, and which the government uses to publicise and seek comments on its policy ideas.  This will often form the basis for a Bill.  Not all provisions/ideas will have a White Paper. |
| BID FOR SLOT IN NEXT SESSION ACCEPTED | A Bill will not be introduced unless it has a slot in the Government's legislative programme.  PBL Committee manages this process and will devise a legislative programme that reflects the Government's priorities.  The Bill Team will need to bid for a slot for your Bill to become a reality.  PBL Committee normally receives double the amounts of bids for the amount of slots available. |
| LAWYERS INSTRUCT PC | Initial instructions usually in a letter sent by e-mail.   These instructions should include:<ul><li>what the Government is trying to achieve (policy aim)</li><li>policy background</li><li>legal background</li><li>other relevant matters: e.g., devolution; human rights; consequential amendments; transitional arrangements.</li></ul>The aim of the instructions is to communicate the intended effect of the Bill, but not to tell PC what to draft or how to do the actual drafting.<br>Follow up instructions by letter e-mailed/e-mails.<br>Meetings with PC may sometimes by necessary. |
| DRAFT BILL FROM PC | PC will put together a draft Bill based on the instructions received.  There is likely to be lots of back and forth between policy, the Bill lawyers and PC during the drafting of a Bill. Ministers may also be involved in terms of signing off actual words/phrases used.   |
| REVISED DRAFT BILL FROM PC | As above |
| DRAFT EXPLANATORY NOTES | ENs are published alongside every Government Bill.   Their purpose is to help the reader grasp what the Bill does, how it does it and to provide helpful background.  The Bill team will normally commission policy teams to draft ENs.  These will need to be cleared by Bill lawyers and with PC. |
| PBL COMMITTEE | When a Bill is ready for introduction it should be circulated to PBL committee.  The Bill is accompanied by a legal issues memorandum, the ENs, impact assessments, parliamentary handling strategy and a delegated powers memorandum.  PBL committee will normally meet to decide on whether the Bill is ready for introduction and will have to agree that it is ready for introduction before it proceeds. |
| QUEEN'S SPEECH | At the state opening of Parliament at the beginning of each session, the Queen delivers a Speech setting out details of the Government's proposed legislative programme.  It lists the Bills which the Government intends to introduce, although is neither comprehensive nor binding. |

### Things to make sure you cover about early stages:

* Role of Bill lawyers
   * (see above re: "Lawyers instruct PC" and "Detailed Policy Worked Up") plus preparing ECHR memorandum, DP memorandum, ENs.
* Role of the Bill Team:
   * A Bill Team and Bill manager should be set up as soon as a slot has been secured. The Bill Team usually consists of policy officials.  Their role is to produce and monitor progress against a delivery plan, co-ordinate all work on the Bill, and update and advise Ministers.
* Role of lead lawyer: 
   * A lead lawyer will often be appointed to co-ordinate Bill lawyers and advise the Bill team and act as the main point of contact with PC.

## House of Commons Stage

| Board Square | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| FIRST READING / BILL INTRODUCED | Clerk reads out the short title of the Bill.  A Minister (or Whip) nods assent and the Bill is taken to have been read a first time. No debate occurs. | 
| SECOND READING | First opportunity for substantial debate.  The House is asked to agree the principles of the Bill and to send it on to the next stage.  Members give notice of the issues they are likely to want to probe by amendments at later stages.  No amendments are tabled at this stage. |
| PUBLIC BILL COMMITTEE | Once a Bill has received a Second Reading in the House of Commons it will usually be sent to a PUBLIC BILL COMMITTEE for line-by-line consideration of the Bill.<br>Alternatively, and less often, a Bill may be referred to a Committee of the Whole House, which is taken on the floor of the Commons.<br>First opportunity to table amendments to the Bill.  Only Committee members can table these. For Government Bills that start in the Commons, the Committee may take written or oral evidence. |
| REPORT AND THIRD READING | Report is when the Bill is returned to the House after it has passed through Committee stage.  The whole House reviews the amended form of the Bill.  This is an opportunity for the House to reconsider the Bill and to table for further amendments. Typically, Third Reading follows Report immediately.  This is a final debate on the Bill. No amendments may be made at this time. Once a Bill has been read a third time, it is said to have been passed by the Commons. |  
| BILL PASSED TO HOUSE OF LORDS | After Third Reading the Bill is sent to the House of Lords where it is given its First Reading. |

### Things to make sure you cover about House of Commons Stage

* Role of the Bill lawyer – clearing Minister's speaking notes; sitting in the box (advising on legal issues when they come up)

## House of Lords Stage

| Board Square | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| FIRST READING / BILL INTRODUCED | As with the Commons, with some procedural differences. |
| SECOND READING | As with the Commons, with some procedural differences. |
| COMMITTEE OF WHOLE HOUSE | Committee Stage is usually taken on the floor of the House (in the Main Chamber).  However, Bills may be considered by GRAND COMMITTEE.  This is open to all peers but does not take place on the floor of the House - usually in the Moses Room. |
| REPORT | The whole House reviews the amended Bill.   |
| THIRD READING | Unlike in the Commons, Report is not taken at the same time as Third Reading.Further amendments may be moved, but amendments at Third Reading must be to clarify any remaining uncertainties, to improve the drafting, or to enable the Government to fulfill undertakings given at earlier stages of the Bill. |
| PING PONG | If the first House does not agree to all the amendments made by the second House, the Bill passes back and forth until agreement is reached. |
| ROYAL ASSENT | Queen's assent formally notified to both Houses; the Bill now becomes an Act! |

## Implementation

| Board Square | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| DRAFT COMMENCEMENT REGULATIONS | Some of the provisions in the Act may come into force on a date specified by the Act.  Most provisions are likely to need commencement regulations to bring them into force. |
| DRAFT GUIDANCE | The Act may include sections concerning statutory guidance and/or the making/issuing of Codes of Practice. |
| DRAFT IMPLEMENTING SIS | Your Act may give you power to make regulations to supplement the Act.  There may be other powers in existence that you need to rely on to make secondary legislation to put in place what you need. |
| PILOT SCHEME | Your Act may contain specific provision that allows you to pilot (test), before rolling out across the country and may specifically allow you to test in specific areas of the country. |
| IN FORCE: REST OF ENGLAND | Your Act may give power to Welsh Ministers to implement provisions which concern devolved issues, in which case you may be dealing only with implementation in England. |
| IN FORCE: WALES | As above. |

### Things to make sure you cover when dealing with the implementation stage:

You will need to begin to think and plan implementation (including deciding who will draft the orders) as the Bill is going through the House.

| Early Stages |
|   | SpAd reminds you that part of your idea is contrary to a manifesto commitment. Go back 1 space. | SpAds (Minister's special advisers) keep a close eye on policy ideas and provide Ministers with political advice. |   |
|   | Simplify idea in response to White Paper consultation responses. Go forward 1 space. | A White Paper is a document which sets out the government's proposals for future legislation, and which the government uses to publicise and seek comments on its policy ideas.  The proposals in the White Paper and the responses to the consultation will often form the basis for a Bill.   | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/white-paper/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/white-paper/) |
|   | BEIS says your idea will result in UK failing to meet CO2 emissions targets. Miss a turn while it is re-designed. | Other departments may have interest in or responsibility for a policy area.  Watch out for unexpected consequences of policy ideas. |   |
|   | No. 10 are not prepared to support your idea. Go back to square 1. | No.10 refers to the Prime Minister and the advisers or civil servants supporting him or her. If the PM doesn't support your policy, it's unlikely to make it into law. |   |
|   | AGO inform you that your idea is not ECHR-compliant. Go back 2 spaces. | "AGO" stands for the Attorney General's Office.  The Attorney General is the government's chief legal adviser.  "ECHR" is the European Convention on Human Rights.  The government will want to be able to certify that the Bill complies with the ECHR. | See paragraphs 3.11 and 3.12 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | Welsh Govt lawyers say idea will involve legislating in area of devolved competence. Go back 1 space. | The government has delegated law-making powers to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  UK Parliament can legislate in areas of devolved competence, but a legislative consent motion from the devolved legislature is required. This may cause delays. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/devolved-and-reserved-matters/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/devolved-and-reserved-matters/) [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/legislative-consent/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/legislative-consent/)See Chapter 15 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | Realise that Queen's Consent will be needed. Miss a turn while write to Palace. | Queen's Consent needed if proposal will affect royal prerogative, hereditary revenues, or the Crown's personal property or interests. Palace will generally require at least 14 days to consider a request. Examples where consent is needed include where the Queen's staff or private estates are affected by a proposal. | See paragraph 3.17 and Chapter 18 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | Scope of Bill will be wider than expected. Go back 1 space. | Scope affects which amendments can be tabled and is determined by House authorities. There may be handling difficulties if scope too wide as Bill might then be used to debate amendments on controversial topics. | See paragraphs 32.35 and 32.52 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | House Authorities say Bill potentially hybrid. Go back to square 1. | A Bill may be hybrid if it adversely affects some private or local interests in a way that is different from others in the same group. (It might do this by applying only to a named area or named bodies).  The procedure for hybrid Bills is different to non-hybrid Bills.  It involves consulting those private interests, and there is a special committee stage which considers petitions against the Bill.  Very important for government Bills not to be "hybrid" unintentionally as this would mean long delays as a result of the special procedures. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/hybrid-bills/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/hybrid-bills/) |
|   | No.10 says it wants the Bill introduced before Party Conference. Go forward 3 spaces. | Political factors may affect timing of introduction of Bills. You may need to be ready to act quickly! |   |
|   | Supreme Court decision means that large part of policy needs rethinking. Go back 2 spaces. | If the Supreme Court decide that the law is different to what your lawyers think it is, this may mean you need to do something very different to achieve your policy idea. |   |
|   | PC advise that two different limbs of the policy conflict. Miss a turn while deciding what to do. | "PC" means Parliamentary Counsel, who draft nearly all government Bills and will test the coherence of the policy when doing so. They have an overview of what Bill is doing. |   |
|   | Complicated policy turns out simpler than expected once drafted, reducing clause count. Go forward 1 space. | A Bill is usually divided into clauses and Schedules, so the number of clauses gives a rough and ready indication of its size and complexity. If the Bill is shorter, the Bill will probably take less time to get through Parliament. |   |
|   | Your legal team syndicate win the Lottery and resign en masse – miss a turn. | You will need to find some new lawyers – this might take a bit of time! |   |
|   | Treasury say proposed funding mechanism breaches government accounting conventions – need to re-design. Miss a turn. | The Treasury police government spending and raising of funds, and will work to ensure a consistent approach is taken. |   |
|   | Stakeholders respond positively to the policy on consultation. Roll again. | Good news – you are doing well at convincing people of your idea. |   |
|   | Another department's Part of the Bill is dropped. Shorter Bill means handling will be easier. Go forward 2 spaces. | One department will usually be in overall charge of a Bill, but Bills often contain provisions for which other departments are responsible. |   |
|   | New criminal offences in the Bill are cleared by HA. Go forward 1 space. | The Home Affairs Committee will need to be consulted on any proposal that would result in the creation of a new criminal offence, or changes to an existing one. Clearance is needed before the offences can be included in the Bill. |   |
|   | Your Minister is on holiday and so can't sign the section 19 HRA statement. Miss a turn waiting for her return. | Section 19 statement under Human Rights Act 1998 needs to be signed by minister in charge of the Bill before it can be handed in for introduction.  The statement confirms the Bill complies with the ECHR. | See paragraph 3.11 and pages 113 to 119 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | PBL Committee decide that the Bill will be introduced in Commons; handling strategy was based on introduction in Lords. Go back 2 spaces. | The Parliamentary Business and Legislation Committee is a cabinet committee with responsibility for oversight of the government's legislative programme. PBL Committee checks the readiness of Bills for introduction and decides which House a Bill should be introduced in. | See pages 8 to 10, paragraphs 3.22 and 3.23 and Chapter 20 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | Chief Whip reminds you that part of your idea is contrary to a DUP manifesto commitment.Roll the dice: roll 4 to 6, you have enough votes for the Bill to proceed, move forward 2 spaces; roll 1 to 3, you do not have the votes, move back 2 spaces. | The Government has not entered into a formal coalition with the DUP – they have reached a confidence and supply agreement which relates only to limited matters.  Where the Government does not have the support of the DUP, it will need the support of other parties to achieve a majority. |   |
| House of Commons |
|   | Argue with Whips over timings in programme motion. Go back 1 space. | A programme motion is tabled for most Government Bills before Second Reading in the Commons. It provides a means of regulating and limiting the amount of time spent on the Bill at the various Commons stages. The motion usually commits the Bill to a Public Bill Committee and specifies when the proceedings in Committee stage are to end. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/programme-motion/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/programme-motion/)See Chapter 29 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Potential backbench revolt on terms of money resolution. Go back 2 spaces. | A money resolution needs to be tabled before Second Reading if a Bill will create new heads of government expenditure or increase existing ones. A clause / Schedule or an amendment requiring a money resolution will not be debated unless and until the money resolution has been passed. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/money-resolution/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/money-resolution/) |
|   | Welsh Govt say legislative consent motion won't be passed in time. Miss a turn. | The Government will not usually take forward a Bill that makes provision that could be made by the National Assembly for Wales unless the Assembly consents by passing a legislative consent motion. Sometimes it can take longer than expected for the Assembly to do so. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/legislative-consent/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/legislative-consent/)See Chapter 15 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Amendments mean ways and means resolution needed. Go back 1 space. | Ways and means resolutions are needed for any provisions that would impose a charge on the people.  As with money resolutions, ways and means resolutions need to be passed before the relevant provision is debated. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/ways-and-means-resolution/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/ways-and-means-resolution/) See Chapter 28 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Adverse report from Joint Committee on Human Rights. Miss a turn considering response. | This is joint committee of both Houses of Parliament.  One of its functions is to look at the human rights implications of Bills. The Government will take its recommendations very seriously. | [http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/) See paragraphs 12.30 to 12.35 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | Forget to signify Queen's Consent. Go back 2 spaces. | Where Queen's Consent to a Bill is needed and has been given via the Palace, the Minister needs to signify that Consent has been given. This happens at Third Reading. The department needs to brief the Minister in advance to do so. | See Chapter 18 (and, in particular, paragraphs 18.16 to 18.19) of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Bill manager resigns. Go back 2 spaces. | The department in charge of a Bill will appoint a Bill manager to run the administration of the Bill on a day to day basis. He or she co-ordinates all the work on the Bill and you will need to act quickly if you lose yours. | See Chapter 6 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | PBL Sec insist on a write-round on proposed amendment. Miss a turn. | Unless amendments to a Bill are purely minor and technical, they will need to be cleared by PBL Committee before they can be tabled. Clearance is usually obtained by your Minister writing round to other departments, but this can take time and so needs to be factored into the timetable for tabling amendments. | See paragraph 32.42 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | An emergency Bill is introduced, delaying your next Commons stage by a week. Miss a turn. | Bills may pass through both Houses of Parliament in a matter of days if special procedures are used and the Opposition agrees; but this has the potential to delay other Bills. | See paragraph 5.23 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
|   | A controversial Bill is dropped, leaving spare Parliamentary time. Roll the dice: roll 4 to 6, you are ready for next stage, move forward 2 spaces; roll 1 to 3, you are not ready: stay put. | Political factors can affect the parliamentary timetable. If one Bill is dropped, there may be time for another to move forward more quickly than planned.  But this can only happen if you are ready – e.g., your amendments are ready for tabling early. |   |
|   | Proposed Govt amendment is outside scope of the Bill; instruction to House needed. Miss a turn while this is arranged. | The scope of the Bill is determined by the House authorities. Amendments must be within the scope of the Bill as otherwise they will not be selected. If an amendment is outside the Bill's scope but would extend scope to cover objects that are "cognate to the general purposes" of the Bill, it is possible to authorise the introduction of the amendment on a motion of the House. |   |
|   | Money resolution does not cover proposed Govt amendment. Go back 2 spaces. | The Government will need to table a further money resolution covering the amendment before it can be selected. As the resolution is being tabled after Second Reading, it is debatable and therefore time will need to be found in the House.  The Whips may not be happy about this! | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/money-resolution/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/money-resolution/)See Chapter 28 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Policy found to involve state aid – delay while consulting the EU Commission. Miss a turn. | If your policy involves doing something that may be contrary to EU law, the EU Commission will need to be consulted before you go further.This will be subject to change post-Brexit, but the UK remains subject to EU law until Brexit takes effect. |   |
|   | Accept an Opposition amendment which addresses a problematic issue in the Bill. Roll again. | PBL Committee clearance will be required before the government votes in favour of an opposition amendment. Parliamentary Counsel should be consulted on the drafting of the amendment to ensure it secures the desired result, and where it does not, it may be worth offering a concessionary amendment. But accepting an opposition amendment may be attractive in terms of making handling easier. | See paragraphs 23.31 to 23.40 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | The Bill will be carried over to the next session. You need a carry over motion, a new section 19 HRA statement and revised ENs. Miss a turn. | If it is not possible to complete the passage of a Bill before the end of the session in which it is first introduced then it can be carried over to the next session on a motion of the House.  It will then resume proceedings in the next session from where it was in the last session (rather than having to start again from scratch).   | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/carry-over-motions-bills/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/carry-over-motions-bills/)See Chapter 34 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | The PBO Clerk's selection and grouping of amendments is not what was expected. Speaking notes have to be rearranged. Go back 1 space. | Amendments on the same or similar topics are grouped in order to facilitate debate. In the Commons, the PBO will liaise with Parliamentary Counsel on suggested groupings. The department can make suggestions but ultimately the groupings are the decision of the Committee Chair or Speaker on advice from the Public Bill Office.  So your best guesses may turn out to be wrong, which means the Minister's speech may need to be re-organised very quickly. | See paragraphs 32.52 to 32.60 and 33.10 to 33.12 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | A group of backbench MPs threatens to vote against the Bill unless it is amended in a manner which is contrary to the Government's position.  Miss a turn whilst you decide your next move. | A Bill cannot be passed unless a majority of MPs vote for it.  If the Government loses the support of its backbench, this would make passing a Bill even more difficult. |   |
|   | Just before Introduction you realise that the ENs do not contain the analysis needed for the purposes of EVEL.  Roll the dice: roll 4 to 6, you are able to add this to the ENs in time, move forward 2 spaces; roll 1 to 3, you are not ready in time: move backwards 1 space. | EVEL: English Votes for English Laws.  Commons procedure which arose in response to the "West Lothian question", _i.e._, Scottish MPs may vote on Bills that are England-only, but not _vice versa_.EVEL gives MPs representing constituencies in England, or England and Wales, a final say over any provision that affects England, or England and Wales, only.The ENs need to contain an analysis of which provisions of a Bill apply only to England, or only to England and Wales.   The Speaker will rely on this analysis to certify whether a Bill (or certain of its provisions) are England-only or England and Wales-only. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/explanatory-notes/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/explanatory-notes/)See paragraphs 3.10, 11.19 to 11.22 and Chapter 26 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)  |
|   | Legislative Grand Committee gives consent to clauses certified as England-only: move forward 2 spaces. | Where certain clauses are certified as England-only (or England and Wales-only), there is an extra stage between Report and Third Reading where those provisions have to be agreed by a Legislative Grand Committee composed of England-only (or England and Wales-only) MPs. | See Chapter 26 and paragraphs 33.15 to 33.22 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |

|   | Lords vote to refer Bill to Examiners. Miss a turn waiting for outcome. | The Lords PBO will examine the Bill to see if it affects any private interests (i.e. whether it raises hybridity issues). If they think it does, they will refer the Bill to the Examiners. Even if the Lords PBO thinks the Bill is not hybrid, the House may still pass a motion to refer the Bill to the Examiners.  Second Reading cannot be moved until their report is received. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/examiner-of-petitions/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/examiner-of-petitions/)See Chapter 44 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |
|   | Government defeat – Opposition amendment made. Go back 2 spaces. | Due to the political composition of the House and the number of cross-benchers, defeats in the Lords are generally more likely to occur than in the Commons. By convention the government will not try to reverse a Lords defeat at a later Lords stage. |   |
| | DPRRC objects to negative procedure in one of your powers. Roll the dice: roll 4 to 6: convince them that negative procedure is ok; roll 1 to 3: miss a turn while PC drafts an amendment. | The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is a Lords select committee. They will scrutinise the Bill after first reading and report to the House (usually before Committee stage) on the appropriateness or otherwise of powers in the Bill to make secondary legislation, and the parliamentary procedures which apply to that legislation. It is sometimes necessary to amend the Bill in order to address their recommendations and avoid a government defeat. | See Chapter 16 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |

|   | No Lords amendments (so miss out Ping Pong) – go straight to Royal Assent after Third Reading. | Bill only needs to go back to the Commons for ping-pong if the Lords have passed amendments. |   |

|   | An amendment raises a retrospection issue. Advice from the AGO is needed. Go back 1 space. | AGO consent is required for a provision that has retrospective effect i.e. it "changes the previously definite and predictable consequences of part transactions, actions or events in a way that could not have been reasonably expected by those who are affected". | See paragraphs 13.9 to 13.11 of the Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf) |
| Ping pong |
|   | New programme motion needed. Miss a turn. | At the completion of the Lords stages the Bill will go back to the Commons for consideration of any amendments made in the Lords. Proceedings on consideration can be programmed so as to regulate the amount of time in respect of particular amendments or groups of amendments. | http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/programme-motion/ |
|   | Roll the dice. Throw 1: double insistence rule results in loss of entire Bill – go back to square 1; throw 3 or 5: one Lords amendment rejected - stay put; throw 2, 4 or 6: all Lords amendments accepted - go to Royal Assent. | Double insistence occurs when there have been 3 shots at the same target during ping-pong i.e. (1) Commons disagrees to Lords amendment, (2) Lords insists on their amendment, and (3) Commons insists on their disagreement. Bill is lost on the second insistence. Options to ensure this does not happen might include the Commons amending the Lords amendment or disagreeing to the amendment but offering different amendments in lieu. | [http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/double-insistence/](http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/double-insistence/)See Chapter 40 of Guide to Making Legislation (Ping Pong): [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)  See Chapter 41 of Guide to Making Legislation (Royal Assent): [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)   |

Go back 2 spaces. | Bills will often include power for the detail to be filled in by regulations to be made by the government – e.g. the precise information to be provided when applying for a benefit.  But the regulations have to fit within the power. | See paragraph 42.2 of Guide to Making Legislation: [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment\_data/file/645652/Guide\_to\_Making\_Legislation\_Jul\_2017.pdf](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/645652/Guide_to_Making_Legislation_Jul_2017.pdf)  |

|   | The JCSI object to the drafting of your implementing regulations. Miss a turn. | The JCSI is the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments.  Most regulations made under Acts are statutory instruments which must be scrutinised by Parliament.  The JCSI looks at these regulations and draws the attention of both Houses to matters like defective drafting and doubts about whether they fit within the powers in the Act. | http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/statutory-instruments/ |

|   | Accidentally repeal old criminal offences before new ones in force – major political embarrassment – go back 2 spaces. | An Act will often repeal old law that is to be replaced by the new law.  It will frequently allow the Government to decide when different bits of the Act come into operation.  Problems can arise if those bits are brought into force in the wrong order. |   |
|   | Lots of extra consequential amendments are needed. Miss a turn drafting an order making them | Tidying up amendments to the existing law may be made by an Act itself, or that Act may give power to the government to make them later by regulations. |   |
